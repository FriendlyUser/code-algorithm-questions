"""
We use depth-first traversal and create a copy of each node while traversing the graph. To avoid getting stuck in cycles, weâ€™ll use a hashtable to store each completed node and will not revisit nodes that exist in the hashtable. The hashtable key will be a node in the original graph, and its value will be the corresponding node in the cloned graph.
